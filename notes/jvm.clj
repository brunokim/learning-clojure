(ns learning.jvm)

; Clojure is ported to the JVM, Javascript and CLR. Integrationg with
; the host is quite straightforward. Here I'll show Java integration.

; Strings are Java's strings, as they are immutable and fit nicely with a functional environment
(class "What is this?")

; We may call Java methods easily
(.substring "This is Sparta!" 0 11)

; As well as static methods
(Math/log10
 (/ 1.0
    (- (Math/exp 4) 1.0)))

; Unfortunetely, they are not function types and can't be passed to higher-order functions
(map .toUpperCase ["this" "is" "Sparta"])
(map Math/log10 [1 10 100 1000])

; We can solve this wrapping them inside functions
(map (fn [s] (.toUpperCase s)) ["this" "is" "Sparta"])
(map (fn [i] (Math/log10 i)) [1 10 100 1000])

; We may bring in anything present in the classpath
(import java.net.URL)

; Constructors may be called with new or appended with a period
(new URL "http" "www.google.com" 80 "/index.html")
(URL. "http" "www.google.com" 80 "/index.html")

; Clojure also provides a good interoperability in the reverse way. For some nice examples, check
